 Arithmetic operators practice

# Addition(+), Subtraction(-), Division(/), Multiplication(*), Exponentiation(**), Remainder(%)
# To get only the quotient in division, use //, and to get only the remainder, use %.

# Example of using %
# When performing a million repetitive operations, you may want to know the progress in units of 1000.

# n%1000 == 0 - If the condition is True, handle the logic for that case.

# Basic arithmetic operations practice
print(1 + 2)
print(4 / 2)
print(2 * 2)

# The priority of operations: Parentheses take precedence
print(1 + 2 * 3)
print((1 + 2) * 3)

# Getting quotient and remainder
print("When dividing 5 by 2, the quotient is:", 5 // 2)
print("When dividing 5 by 2, the remainder is:", 5 % 2)

# Understanding string operations: Only + and * are allowed
# Predict the result of string operations
print("a" + "b")
print("a" * 3)
print("a" + 3)  # This will cause an error
print("a" * "b")  # Multiplication between strings also causes an error
