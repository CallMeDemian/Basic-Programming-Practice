# Programming practice using external modules

# Displaying time using the time and datetime modules
# Calling external modules - treat functions within the module like built-in functions without mentioning the module name

# from module_name import *

from datetime import *
from time import *

# Calculate and print the difference between two dates
print(date(2030, 12, 31) - date(2030, 5, 31))

# Print the difference in days between two dates
print((date(2030, 12, 31) - date(2030, 5, 31)).days) # days delete

# Print the current time
print("Function to print current time: datetime.now()", datetime.now())
