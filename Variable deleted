# When a variable is declared, memory is used in the Python program.
# The more variables you use, the more memory is consumed.
# Therefore, a good program explicitly deletes variables when they are no longer needed.

# Declare a new variable
new_var = "Hello Demian"

# Check the value stored in the variable
print(new_var)

# How to delete a declared variable
del(new_var)

# How to check if the variable was successfully deleted?
print(new_var)
