# Printing multiplication table for 2 vs. Printing tables for 2 through 9

# Setting a goal to implement the multiplication table for 2
# Coding with pseudocode
# Fix the value of 2
# Represent the multiplication symbol as "x"
# Multiply by numbers from 1 to 9

# Output format:
# 2 x 1 = 2
# 2 x 2 = 4
# ...
# 2 x 9 = 18

# for i in range(1, 10):
#     print("2 x {} = {}".format(i, 2 * i))

# Implementing the multiplication tables from 2 to 9
# Repeat for numbers 2 to 9, and for each, multiply by numbers 1 to 9
# To distinguish between tables, print "--" * 10 after each table

# Output format:
# 2 times table -- 2 x 1 = 2
# ---------------------
# 3 times table -- 3 x 1 = 3

# Nested for loop: A structure where a for loop is inside another for loop

for a in range(2, 10): 
    for b in range(1, 10): 
        print("{} x {} = {}".format(a, b, a * b))
    print("--" * 10)
