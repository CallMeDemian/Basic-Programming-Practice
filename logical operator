# Practicing logical operators

# Logical operators combine two relational expressions and return a boolean result (True, False).
# and: "and", returns True only if both conditions are True.
# or: "or", returns True if at least one condition is True.
# not: "not", inverts the result; returns False if True, and True if False.

# Example of using logical operators
print(10 > 100 and 10 < 100)  # Both conditions need to be True, result is False
print(10 > 100 or 10 < 100)   # At least one condition needs to be True, result is True
print(not(10 > 1000))         # Inverts the result, 10 > 1000 is False, so the result is True

# Given the following conditions, how to make the expression evaluate to True
a = 1
b = 2
print(a == b or a < b)        # a < b is True, so the result is True
print(not(a == b))            # a == b is False, so the result is True after applying not

# Note:
# Examples like the above, using relational and logical operators, are typically not used in this form in real programming.
# These are for conceptual understanding and are applied in various ways in real programming scenarios.
