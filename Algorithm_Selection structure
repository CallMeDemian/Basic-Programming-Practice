# Selection structure - What if!
# This structure evaluates a condition and decides whether to execute the code block based on the result.

# Declare variables to print
name1 = "Call me Demian"
name2 = "Demian"

# Example of executing a code block in a conditional structure
# 1. When the condition is True
if True:
    print("Hello: " + name1)  # Check if the statement is executed: Yes

# 2. When the condition is False
if False:
    print("Hello: " + name2)  # Check if the statement is executed: No
