# Coin exchange program

# Assume there is a bill worth 7,777 won
# There are 500-won, 100-won, 50-won, 10-won, 5-won, and 1-won coins available

# Define the bill to exchange - defined as a variable
money = 7777

# c500 - 500-won coin modeling
c500 = money // 500  # Divide 7777 won by 500 and store the quotient
money %= 500  # Store the remainder after dividing 7777 won by 500

# c100 - 100-won coin modeling
c100 = money // 100  # Divide 7777 won by 100 and store the quotient
money %= 100  # Store the remainder after dividing 7777 won by 100

# c50 - 50-won coin modeling
c50 = money // 50  # Divide 7777 won by 50 and store the quotient
money %= 50  # Store the remainder after dividing 7777 won by 50

# c10 - 10-won coin modeling
c10 = money // 10  # Divide 7777 won by 10 and store the quotient
money %= 10  # Store the remainder after dividing 7777 won by 10

# c5 - 5-won coin modeling
c5 = money // 5  # Divide 7777 won by 5 and store the quotient
money %= 5  # Store the remainder after dividing 7777 won by 5

# c1 - 1-won coin modeling
c1 = money // 1  # Divide 7777 won by 1 and store the quotient
money %= 1  # Store the remainder after dividing 7777 won by 1
