# Grade Calculator Program

# Goal - Pseudocode
# Get the score as input and print the grade as follows:
# If the score is 90 or above, print "You got an A."
# If the score is 80 or above but less than 90, print "You got a B."
# If the score is 70 or above but less than 80, print "You got a C."
# If the score is 60 or above but less than 70, print "You got a D."
# If the score is less than 60, print "You got an F."

# Implementation

# Get the score as input and assign it to a variable
score = int(input("Enter your score: "))

# Implement the logic
# if score >= 90:
#     print("You got an A.")
# elif score >= 80 and score < 90:
#     print("You got a B.")
# elif score >= 70 and score < 80:
#     print("You got a C.")
# elif score >= 60 and score < 70:
#     print("You got a D.")
# else:
#     print("You got an F.")

# Simpler implementation
if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
elif score >= 60:
    grade = "D"
else:
    grade = "F"

print(f"You got a {grade}.")
