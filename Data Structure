# Data Structure
# Types of data structures
# List, Tuple, Dictionary, Set

# List
# A one-dimensional data arrangement structure
# Example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Index - Refers to the position of data in the structure
# Index starts from 0

# Tuple
# An immutable data arrangement structure
# Example: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
# Read-only data structure - The values inside the structure cannot be changed
# Tuples have indexes but no methods related to order

# Set
# A data structure with no order and only unique values
# Example: {1, 2, 3}
# {1, 2, 3, 2} => {1, 2, 3}

# Dictionary
# An unordered data structure made up of multiple key-value pairs
# Keys must be unique
# Example: {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2", ...}
