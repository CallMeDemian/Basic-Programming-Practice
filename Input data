# Input statement (input) - A function that receives data through input devices like a keyboard

# Basic user input is handled using the input() function

# Receive input value from the user and store it in the variable 'name'
# name = input("Enter your name: ")
# print(name)

# Note! The input() function processes the received input as a string

a = input("Enter the first number: ")
print(a, type(a))

# Convert the received string to an integer
a = int(a)
print(a, type(a))

# Experiment with string to number conversion
c = input("Experiment: ")
c = int(c)
print(c, type(c))
