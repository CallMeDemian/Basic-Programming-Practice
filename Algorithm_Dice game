# Algorithm - A series of steps organized to process a task

# Algorithm representation methods:
# 1. Natural language
# 2. Flowchart
# 3. Pseudo code
# 4. Programming language

# Algorithms consist of sequential structure, selection structure, and loop structure.

# Basic design for implementing a dice game

# Basic logic design:
# Two people, A and B, roll dice, and the person with the higher number wins.

# Possible scenarios:
# 1. A wins
# 2. B wins
# 3. It's a tie

# Things to consider:
# 1) When rolling a die, a random number between 1 and 6 occurs.
# 2) How can we generate such random numbers in Python?

# There is a concept of external modules.
# Using an external module to generate random numbers makes the implementation easier.
# Just like in most programming languages, Python has an external module for generating random numbers.
# While this is an external module, Python often includes it by default.
# If not provided by default, you can install it using the command "pip install module_name".

# How to use external modules in Python:
# Since it's not a built-in feature, you need to explicitly declare that you're using it.
# Method 1: import module_name
# Method 2: import module_name as alias
# Method 3: from module_name import function_name (method_name)

# What are modules, libraries, and packages?

# 1. A module is a reusable collection of code that performs specific functions.
# 2. A package is a collection of modules grouped by a common theme.
# 3. A library is a collection of related packages.

# In practice, the terms module, library, and package are often used interchangeably without strict distinction.

# What are functions and methods?

# 1. A function is a pre-written block of code that performs a specific action.
#    You can call a function by using function_name(arguments).

# 2. A method is similar to a function but is specifically part of an external module (or class).
#    Methods are usually referred to as methods when they belong to a class or module.

# In practice, the terms function and method are often used interchangeably.

# Basic format for importing external modules and using their functions (methods):

# Method 1 - module_name.function
# Dice rolling can be implemented with the following code:
# import random
# rand_num = random.randrange(1, 7) # Possible outputs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 
# print(rand_num)


# GenAI - Learn how to use and apply the randrange method from Python's random module.
# Please provide the usage and example code for the randrange method from the random module in Python.

# import random

# # Code to randomly select a number from 1 to 10
# random_number = random.randrange(1, 11)
# print(random_number)

# # Code to randomly select a number from 0 to 100 in steps of 10
# random_number = random.randrange(0, 101, 10)
# print(random_number)

# # Code to simulate rolling a dice by randomly selecting a number from 1 to 6
# dice_number = random.randrange(1, 7)
# print("The result of the dice roll:", dice_number)


# Importing external modules and using their functions:
# Usage: Functions can be used in the same way as built-in functions like print.

from random import randrange
dice = randrange(1, 7)
print(dice)

# Tip for functions:
# To check which methods are included in a module:
# Type the module name followed by a few letters of the method and see what functions are available.
# Select the desired function and press the Tab key, and the full name will autocomplete.

# import random.randrange
